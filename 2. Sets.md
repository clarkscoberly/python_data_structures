# Sets

### Introduction

A **Set** is a data structure that much like an array or list is meant to store data and does so with an index system that allows you to both iterate through it or find a particular index for retrieval. The major difference and power of the **set** is it's inability to hold duplicate records. 

This is extremely important throughout our society with username and password combinations being so important. Your email can't be used by someone else to sign up for an account, your social security number is the only one of it's kind, your phone number can't be picked up by another carrier. Each of these allows us to live in a shared world with unique applications of the **set** data structure keeping us individual.

### Purpose and Characteristics

**UNIQUE ITEMS:**

As previously discussed having a list that only keeps track of unique iterations of data is a powerful tool. This allows you to no longer worry about if data is included more than once in a given array and can instead focus on the what that array needs to accomplish. Whether this is by keeping track of unique identifiers of an employee or their location on payroll we can minimize impact of duplicates simply by removing them with a set. Further it's performance makes it an attractive option being extrememly fast at finding data and adding/removing information from your set.



### Performance

Performance of a **Set** with common operations

Operation | Python Code | Description | Performance 
----------|-------|--------------|------------
add       | my_set.add(value) | Put data into the set if not already included | 0(1)
remove    | my_set.remove() | Take the last item off the end of the set | 0(1)
member    | if value in my_set | Determine if a value is within the set | 0(1)
size     | len(my_set) | Find the number of items in the set | 0(1)

### Example
```python
"""
The following is a basic implementation of a SET

Problem: Check to see how many unique individuals
bought tickets
"""
ticket_buyers = ["George", "Jen", "Frankie", "Pikachu", "This-Guy", "George", "Ben", "Ben"]
# As you can see both George and Ben in this list have bought more than 1 ticket. In a list
# this size it is easy for us to check it ourselves. But imagine for a giant concert where
# They may sell 20,000+ tickets and want to know the number of unique fans who bought tickets

# This can be solved by taking the array and changing it into a set and then comparing the
# Difference in length.
duplicate_buyers = len(ticket_buyers) - len(set(ticket_buyers))
unique_buyers = len(ticket_buyers) - duplicate_buyers

print(duplicate_buyers) # Prints 2
print(unique_buyers) # Prints 6
```

### Problem to Solve
```python
"""
We are trying to figure out if we are accidentally paying one
of our employees more than once. Given a list of employee ID's
determine if we have included more than one of their ID's
"""
employees1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 123, 5125, 6436, 43, 3, 435, 1]
employees2 = []
employees3 = [1, 2, 3]
employees4 = [1, 4, 61]

def main(array):
    pass
        
# Expect True
main(employees1)

# Expect False
main(employees2)

# Expect False
main(employees3)

# Expect False
main(employees4)
```
