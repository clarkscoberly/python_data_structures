# Trees

### Introduction

The **tree** data structure is very similar to a link list and uses many of the same calls in order to be implemented. Perhaps a bit simplistic in nature but the purpose for why the **tree** is given it's name is because of the form it takes on when you attach multiple different pointers or *nodes* to the top most node called the **root** each of these nodes that are connected to the **root** are called **leaves**. These connect further in a parent-child relationship given to each node, and the nodes that are connected to it **children** or the node which is spawns off of, the **parent**.

As is typical for real life trees at the bottom is the trunk connected to the trunk are large limbs which each in turn have smaller and smaller limbs. This is exactly how a **tree** is implemented in python, a single trunk or **root** having many branches with other branches connnected to those, or **leaves**

### Purpose and Characteristics

One significant purpose behind **trees** are their ability, when sorted properly to take huge chunks of data and speed up the process of sorting through them by the clever usage of comparing leaves against eachother to find out which is larger or smaller based on what you are looking to find. 

### Performance

Performance of a **Tree** with common operations

Operation | Description | Performance 
----------|-------|--------------------------
Insert      | Add an item onto the tree | O(log n)
Remove    | Remove the given value from the tree | O(log n)
Contains    | Determine if a value is in the tree | O(log n)
traverse_forward | Visit each item within the tree from smallest to largest | O(n)
traverse_reverse | Visit each item within the tree from largest to smallest | O(n)
Height | Determines the height of the tree from the base node to the furtheest root | O(n)
Size | Gives the size of the tree | O(1)
Empty     | Checks to see if the tree is empty | O(1)


### Example

One use for trees is their ability to iterate through data in order from the root of the tree to the end, effectively it alphabetizes for you or creates a list of numbers from smallest to largest. Of course there are different applications depending on what you are checking for to make the tree you need. In this instance Carly uses a tree in order to get each of the names displayed to pick a family name for her new baby.

```python
"""
Carly has been interested in family history for quite sometime and wants to name 
her new baby a family name but can't decide on which one, so she decides to use 
the following program to iterate through all the names found in her tree to pick 
a name
