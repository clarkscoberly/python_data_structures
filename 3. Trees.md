# Trees

### Introduction

A **tree** is a data structure (WOW!)

Consider the way that you eat icecream for example. The first bites of icecream that you eat when you pull out those first scoops were the last drops of icecream placed within that container during production. **The carton is filled from bottom to top.** Code inside of a **stack** is much the same. You store the first *bits* of code at the bottom of the **stack** and pile other pieces on top of it.

### Purpose and Characteristics

Perhaps the most important of the different uses of the **stack** is that of function calls, especially when these are "nested" and you begin going multiple layers deep calling one function after another. The structure that keeps track of these layers and then is able to go back up the line and return to your original function call with all the relevant data retrieved is the Stack.

One other major purpose of the **stack** is an allowance for a user to reverse the order of data that has been put onto the stack. This functionality is used throughout every day life in the form of the back button on your phone or computer, the undo text operation or even putting your undone actions onto another stack so that you can redo items that you have undone. This is especially true with my coding experience. It feels like every line I type contains at least one instance of me *undoing* what I just typed instead of pressing the backspace. Alongside this every few minutes I find that I've accidentally deleted something and have to *redo* what was previously typed.



### Performance

Performance of a **Stack** with common operations

Operation | Description | Performance 
----------|-------|--------------|------------
Insert      | Add an item onto the tree | 0(log n)
Remove    | Remove the given value from the tree | 0(log n)
Contains    | Determine if a value is in the tree | 0(log n)
traverse_forward | Visit each item within the tree from smallest to largest | O(n)
traverse_reverse | Visit each item within the tree from largest to smallest | O(n)
Height | Determines the height of the tree from the base node to the furtheest root | O(n)
Size | Gives the size of the tree | O(1)
Empty     | Checks to see if the tree is empty | 0(1)
